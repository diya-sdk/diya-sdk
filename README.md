diya-sdk v1.x
========

diya-sdk is a javascript library that enables one to interact with a DiyaOne Network. It communicates over a 
WebSocket transport and can be used on both browsers and NodeJS (using [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws)).


## Architecture

### The DiyaOne network 

The DiyaOne network is designed as a decentralized network of nodes, each of them supporting a set of services. Typical network
nodes include DiyaOne robots, DiyaOne docking stations, or Partnering servers. Using the diya-sdk, one can connect to any one of the reachable network nodes and from there query services of any subset of the network nodes.

Nodes are selected using a simple selector system :

- ```"D1R00018"``` -> selects the D1R00018 node
- ```['D1R0018', 'D1R00019']``` -> selects the D1R00018 and D1R00019 nodes
- ```/^D1R.*$/``` -> selects all nodes whose names start with "D1R"
- ```"#self"``` -> selects the node that the client directly connects to

### Services 

Services running on any network node expose two types of commands that can be queried from a diya-sdk client : requests and 
subscriptions. 

A service can be used directly by calling its requests and subscriptions provided they are documented (see below).
However for some services, some client-side logic must be followed. For these services, modules that implement this logic and wrap requests and subscriptions are provided in the diya-sdk library.

#### Requests

A Request acts exactly like an HTTP request. The client asks for something, the request is executed on the server, and the answer
 is sent back to the client. The only difference is that if the given ```selector``` matches multiple nodes, the request will be 
executed on each nodes, and an answer will be sent back for each node.

#### Subscriptions

A subscription acts as a simple pub/sub mecanism. The client asks a service to listen for one of its events. When the event
 happens on the service side, the client is notified. As with the requests system, if the ```selector``` matches multiple nodes, events will be sent back to the client for each node.


##Â Getting Started 

Enough with the theory, let's code ! diya-sdk is packaged both as a bower package and an npm package, so it is rather easy to include it wherever you need it.

### Browser
#### install
```sh
bower install partnering/diya-sdk
```

#### example code
```html
<!-- include the diya-sdk library -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/diya-sdk/build/diya-sdk.min.js"></script>

<script>

/* 
 * Connect to the node located at 'wss://localhost/api' using the 'toto' login and
 * the 'toto_password' password 
 */
d1.connectAsUser('wss://localhost/api', 'toto', 'toto_password').then(function() {
    /* The connectAsUser method returns a promise that resolve upon successful connection */
    console.log('connected !');

    //From then on, you can perform any requests or subscriptions you want

    /* 
     * this call creates a request 'my_function' to the service 'my_service' with
     * the data { foo: 'bar' } that will be applied to all nodes of the 'wss://localhost/api'
     * network that match the "#self" selector.
     */
    d1("#self").request({
        service: 'my_service',
        func: 'my_function',
        data: {
            foo: 'bar'
    }, function(peerId, err, data) {
	/* 
         * this callback is call for each node that answers the request. the 'peerId' 
         * corresponds to the id of the node that answered, 'err' is defined if there
         * was an error while executing the request, and 'data' is the request's answer
	 */
        console.log(peerId);
        console.log('err');
        console.log(data);
    });


    let sub = d1(/.*/).subscribe({
        service: 'my_service',
        func: 'my_function',
        data: {
            zorblax: 42
    }, function (peerId, err, data) {
        //same as requests    
    });

    ...

    //closes the subscription
    sub.close()

}).catch(function(error) {
    console.log('game over : '+ error);
}); 

</script>
```

### NodeJS
#### install
```sh
npm init
npm install partnering/diya-sdk
npm install ws
npm install q
```
#### example code 
```js
var d1 = require('diya-sdk');
var WebSocket = require('ws');
var Q = require('q');

d1.connectAsUser('wss://localhost/api', 'toto', 'toto_password', WebSocket).then(function() {
    console.log('connected !');

    d1("#self").request({
        service: 'my_service',
        func: 'my_function',
        data: {
            foo: 'bar'
    }, function(peerId, err, data) {
        console.log(data);
    });

}).catch(function(error) {
    console.log('game over : '+ error);
}); 
```
